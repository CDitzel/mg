Change Log
==========

All relevant changes to the project are documented in this file.

[v3.5][UNRELEASED]
------------------

### Changes
- Add support for Solaris/Illumos based UNIX systems.  Tested on OmniOS
- Sync with mg upstream, OpenBSD 7.0, as of May 12, 2021
  - New replace-regexp function, for scripting
  - New dired function, dired-jump activated with C-x C-j
  - New dired-shell-command function for piping file to a command
  - New mgrc batch mode, mostly intended for regression testing
  - New command line option, -u mgrc, to specify startup mgrc file
  - Clarify markers in list-buffers output, more similar to GNU Emacs

### Fixes
- Fix regression; lost path in status line while trying to open a file.  
  Caused by a fix introduced in v3.4 to clear the status line on kill or
  switch buffer by name.  A new fix has been made to handle both cases.
- Fix #10: replace deprecated signal functions with `sigaction()`

---------------------

Most important news is the new modeline and support for building
and running without Ncurses, or termcap/terminfo!

  feature will be welcome for embedded systems, and others who
  cannot, or do not want to, bundle the complete ncurses

  - C-PgDn  end-of-buffer
- Sync with OpenBSD:
  - Update all $OpenBSD: id$ strings
  - Fix -Wshadow warnings

- Modeline changes to mimic GNU Emacs
  - Drop `Mg:`, similar to yur3i/mg/commit/@84ce23b
  - Use space instead of dash `-` as separator, same as @yur3i
  - Hard code std encoding and UNIX end-of-line mode

  issued `C-x b RET` from a fresh started `mg`.
- Bring `fileio.c` up to speed with OpenBSD, r1.102, replacing `TMPDIR`
  with the standard `/tmp` directory for temp files.


[v3.0.1][] - 2016-05-16
-----------------------

Bugfix release.

### Fixes
- Fix `C-a`, `C-e`, `C-space`, etc. regression when Cscope integration,
  `--disable-cscope` or `--disable-all` is selected.


[v3.0][] - 2016-05-15
---------------------

First release based on [Mg2a][] from OpenBSD 5.9.  The work on [Mg3a][],
by Bengt Larsson, is not a part of this project.  The version number was
chosen based on: 2A < 30 < 3A HEX.  The OpenBSD Mg is greatly improved
over the original Mg2a, from 1986, but does not have the same feature
set as Mg3a.

### Changes
- Import mg from OpenBSD 5.9
- Use libite (-lite) to provide missing OpenBSD/NetBSD API's
- Add GNU configure and build system for portability to other systems:
  - Detect existence and correct version of libite (v1.6.0 or later)
  - Detect `-ltermcap`, `-ltinfo`, or `-lcurses`.  We only use the termcap
    functionality in Mg, but can link with either of them
  - Detect `term.h`, we cannot use `termcap.h` because of cookies
  - Make OpenBSD developed features optional with configure,
    e.g. integrated ctags and cscope support
  - Add `--enable-size-optimizations` option
  - Add `--with-startup=FILE` for alternate init file
- Conditionalize OpenBSD specific API's and modules, e.g. the `pledge()`
  API and the `theo.c` module ... `#ifdef __OpenBSD__`
- Add missing `M-x version` for compatibility with GNU Emacs
- Add `-h` command line option for a simple usage text
- Change Mg built-in version to use configure script's `PACKAGE_STRING`
  rather than hardcoded, and rather outdated, `Mg 2a`
- Add LICENSE file, from licensing info (Public Domain) in README
- Add AUTHORS file, from author listing in README
- Create README.md from text in README and `mg.1` with information
  about this project and the motivation for it

### Fixes
- Convert from `fgetln()` to standard POSIX `getline()`
- Convert old `st_mtimespec` to POSIX `st_mtim`
- Add workaround for systems missing `TCSASOFT` flag to `tcsetattr()`
- Import `SO_NOSIGPIPE` patch for OX X from by Han Boetes' Mg porting
  project <http://homepage.boetes.org/software/mg/>
- Encapsulate private `globalwd`data in optional `grep.c` module
- Fix build warnings for missing `asprintf()` family of C API's
- Integration fixes:
  - `fisdir()` already exists in [libite][]
  - `makedir()` is a [libite][] function, rename to `make_dir()`
- Fix unsafe enabling of non-blocking mode on file descriptor used
  when piping buffer contents (`M-|`) to an external program.
- Collect forked off children in `M-|`, missing `waitpid()`
- Fixes for bugs found by Coverity Scan:
  - Fix file descriptor leaks
  - Add missing NULL pointer checks
  - Missing checks for return value from both internal and C library
	functions.  Some simply marked as "don't care"
  - Fix missing initialization of stack variables
